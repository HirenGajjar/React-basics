### Why React ?

- React is a library created by facebook Meta
- UI can be Interactive and Dynamic
- Single page Applications (SPA)
- When we request to browser :- DOM Elements tree (HTML) + CSS Style of each element + JS Helps modify DOM Based on user interactions
- Working on DOM and JS on a large scale can be complicated

- The mental modal of JS can be too complex
- JS can be cumbersome (large, heavy and difficult), Error-prone, Difficult to maintain **_ (building is less difficult then maintain it) _**
- JS is imperative - step to step process to build [write HTML elements, Add style and then select them using JS and manipulate]

- React takes care of creation and DOM manipulation, and querying and saves time
- Creates small and reusable **_components_**
- React is declarative - [write initial state and desire state :- DOM Manipulation will be taken care ]

### Components in react

- A web page is combination of small chunks of reusable code blocks
- App components is root, holding all components together
